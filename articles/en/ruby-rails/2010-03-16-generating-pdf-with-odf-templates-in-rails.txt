title: Generating PDF with ODF templates in Rails
updated_at: 
slug_pt-BR: 2010-03-14-geracao-de-pdf-com-rails-a-partir-de-modelos-odf

In 2009, I wrote an article for the [Rails Magazine](http://railsmagazine.com) Issue #4 - The Future of Rails - where
I presented an alternative to PDF generation from ODF templates, which can be generated using a regular text processor
such as OpenOffice.org or Microsoft Office (after converting the document to ODF).

You can read the entire article [downloading this magazine for free](http://railsmagazine.com/issues/4) or
[purchasing](http://magcloud.com/browse/issue/32751) it. The application code illustrating this approach was published
by the magazine on [Github](http://github.com/railsmagazine/rmag_downloads/tree/master/issue_4/rodrigo_rosas_genpdf/).

Unfortunately, I can't host a working system providing a live demonstration due to my [Heroku](http://heroku.com) count
limitations, but it should be easy to follow the instructions in the article on your development or production environment.

Do not hesitate to sending me any questions, through comments on this site or by e-mail, if you prefer.
